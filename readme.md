# Mr.Burger

Graduation project from courses (website selling burgers)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running (assumes node.js and npm already installed).

Сlone repository from github

```
git clone https://github.com/manifet/mr-burger.git
```

npm install
```


## Deployment

Dev and build differ in costly operations such as code minification, autoprefixer for css, bable, etc. (see gulpfile.js)

```
npm run dev
```
```
npm run build
```
Deploy for deployment on Github Pages

```
npm run deploy
```
